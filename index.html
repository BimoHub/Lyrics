                <p>
                    Remember when we first met?<br>
                    You said "light my cigarette"<br>
                    So I lied to my mom and dad<br>
                    I jumped the fence and I ran<br>
                    But we couldn't go very far<br>
                    'Cause you locked your keys in your car<br>
                    So you sat and stared at my lips<br>
                    And I could already feel your kiss<br><br>
                    Long nights, daydreams<br>
                    Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool<br>
                    But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br><br>
                    Headlights, on me<br>
                    Racing to 60, I've been a fool<br>
                    But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like<br><br>
                    Blue eyes, black jeans<br>
                    Lighters and candy, I've been a fool<br>
                    But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br><br>
                    Remember when you taught me fate<br>
                    Said it'd all be worth the wait<br>
                    Like that night in the back of the cab<br>
                    When your fingers walked in my hand<br>
                    Next day, nothin' on my phone<br>
                    But I can still smell you on my clothes<br>
                    Always hoping things would change<br>
                    But we went right back to your games<br><br>
                    Long nights, daydreams<br>
                    Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool<br>
                    But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br><br>
                    Headlights, on me<br>
                    Racing to 60, I've been a fool<br>
                    But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like<br><br>
                    Blue eyes, black jeans<br>
                    Lighters and candy, I've been a fool<br>
                    But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br><br>
                    And even if I run away<br>
                    Give my heart a holiday<br>
                    Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br><br>
                    You always leave me wanting more<br>
                    I can't shake my hunger for<br>
                    Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br>
                    Yeah, they always taste like you<br><br>
                    Long nights, daydreams<br>
                    With that sugar and smoke rings<br>
                    Always taste like you<br><br>
                    Headlights, on me (and even if I run away)<br>
                    Racing to 60, I've been a fool (and give my heart a holiday)<br>
                    Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like<br>
                    Blue eyes, black jeans (you always leave me wanting more)<br>
                    Lighters and candy, I've been a fool (I can't shake my hunger for)<br>
                    Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you<br>
